                        <h2>CompSki ðŸ’»</h2>
                        <p id="specific">My journey with programming truly began when I was in the eighth grade. My
                            friend
                            Shiv had learnt some basic markup and was trying to show me how you could create a website
                            with
                            HTML. I dabbled with HTML and CSS for a short while but my passion for programming and
                            computer
                            science didn't arise until the sixteenth year
                            of my life. I choose Computer Science and wrote my first line of Java code
                            <code>System.out.println("Hello, World");</code> in early April. My journey with programming
                            only escalated from there, my CS teacher, Rashmita Ma'am, was incredibly helpful and
                            informative
                            and my friend <a href="https://kabiroberai.com" target="_blank"><strong><u>Kabir
                                        Oberai</u></strong></a> (WWDC Scholar 2017) spent most of his free time teaching
                            me.
                            The language I'm most proficient in
                            today is probably <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
                                target="_blank"><u>JavaScript</u> ðŸ¤®</a>. I have extensively worked in web-development
                            using multiple JavaScript libraries and I have an in-depth knowledge of <a
                                href="https://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank"><u>Java</u></a> as well. I'm fairly
                            proficient in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BuJ0finBFO-/"
                                target="_blank"><u>C</u></a>
                            and
                            I've taught a <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"><u>Python</u></a> workshop
                            with

                    <h2>Design ðŸŽ¨</h2>
                    <p id="specific">I was eleven when I was introduced to the wonder world of <a
                            href="https://www.adobe.com" target="_blank"><u>Adobe</u>.</a> My sixth
                        grade
                        computers teacher introduced our whole class to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank"><u>Adobe Flash Professional
                                CS6</u>.</a> Now while the bright
                        minds
                        of 6-C
                        weren't particularly interesting in animating the Hindu god Ganesha, I learnt with fervour and
                        even
                        managed to animate a police officer getting murdered by the end of the year. I've always been
                        abysmal at hand-drawn art, so the fact that I could do something that other people admired and
                        considered art on a computer blew my mind. Now since <a href="https://www.adobe.com"
                            target="_blank"><u>Adobe</u></a> is the most <em>corrupt capitalist
                            company</em>
                        ever, I didn't get to explore my newfound love for animation till much later in my life.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I was in the ninth grade when my brother went to university to study architecture. This is when
                        my
                        journey with design truly began. His course required him to use a lot of <a
                            href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html" target="_blank"><u>Adobe Creative
                                Cloud</u></a>
                        software, so he decided to buy a subscription using his new student discount. This meant that I
                        now
                        had access to a whole world of software that I hadn't touched before. By this point <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" target="_blank"><u>Adobe Flash Professional
                                CS6</u></a> had
                        become deprecated and the new equivalent was <a

                                CC</u>.</a> I managed to create two
                        basic
                        frame-by-frame animations and showed them off to my friends. But by this point, I had become
                        good
                        friends with someone who, to this day, has an unquantifiable influence on my life. <a

                        (A.K.A Josh). He
                        introduced me to the wonderful world of <a

                        animation
                        was a bunch of frame-by-frame doodles on top of a video of me playing the guitar. This, while
                        not
                        being the kind of animation After Effects is suited for, got me sufficiently acquainted with the
                        sotware and my journey only skyrocketed from there. Today, I've made multiple personal motion
                        graphics projects, worked on commissioned animations, videos, album covers, and illustrations
                        for
                        other people, and created pitch videos and app designs for multiple hackathon winning apps. You

                    <h2>Music ðŸŽ¸</h2>
                    <p id="specific"> I was in the fifth grade when I started playing the drums. My three best friends
                        at
                        the time all played instruments. I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt left out. So I went and
                        enrolled at <a
                            href="https://www.justdial.com/Delhi/Asha-Music-Academy-Vasant-Kunj/011PXX11-XX11-110326131506-Q1X8_BZDET"
                            target="_blank"><u>Asha Music Academy</u>.</a> It was there that my love for music really
                        began. Some
                        time
                        later, my told me that she wanted me to start playing the guitar, "Drums aren't a <em>real</em>
                        instrument", seemed to be a popular notion. So I enrolled in guitar classes. I soon learnt that
                        I
                        wasn't cut out of string instruments, and my hatred for the guitar only intensified. I thought a
                        change of music schools might help, so I switched my guitar classes to a different music academy
                        near my house. It was here that my hatred for the guitar <em>really</em> peaked. I left six
                        months
                        later, swearing to never touch that cursed instrument ever again. A few years went by, I
                        continued
                        playing the drums and my guitar sat collecting dust in the far corner of my room. It wasn't till
                        the fourteenth year of my life when I picked up my guitar again. I started re-learning the
                        instrument, with intense dedication and passion and today, I can safely say that I'm a
                        proficient guitarist. As time went by, I learnt the bass, the keyboard, the ukulele, and a whole
                        lot of music theory. My favourite instrument to play today would probably be the guitar, even
                        though I mostly perform as a bassist.

                        I've been a voracious reader for as long as I can remember. I've consumed literature with gusto
                        and naturally, this progressed to me trying my hand at creative writing. I wrote my first proper
                        short story during English class, in grade five. It was called "The Attack of the Telephone
                        Monster", and I immensely enjoyed writing it. Since then, I've continued writing short stories,
                        informative articles, and even ran a blog (deprecated) for four years. I've exercised my
                        propensity for writing in the <a href="https://www.tsrsimprint.com/" target="blank"><u>Editorial
