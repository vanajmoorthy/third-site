                            <p id="specific">My journey with programming truly began when I was in the eighth grade. My

                                Shiv had learnt some basic markup and was trying to show me how you could create a

                                HTML. I dabbled with HTML and CSS for a short while but my passion for programming and

                                science didn't arise until the sixteenth year
                                of my life. I choose Computer Science and wrote my first line of Java code
                                <code>System.out.println("Hello, World");</code> in early April. My journey with

                                only escalated from there, my CS teacher, Rashmita Ma'am, was incredibly helpful and
                                informative

                            minds
                            of 6-C
                            weren't particularly interesting in animating the Hindu god Ganesha, I learnt with fervour
                            and
                            even
                            managed to animate a police officer getting murdered by the end of the year. I've always
                            been
                            abysmal at hand-drawn art, so the fact that I could do something that other people admired
                            and
                            considered art on a computer blew my mind. Now since <a href="https://www.adobe.com"
                                target="_blank"><u>Adobe</u></a> is the most <em>corrupt capitalist

                            ever, I didn't get to explore my newfound love for animation till much later in my life.

                            I was in the ninth grade when my brother went to university to study architecture. This is
                            when
                            my
                            journey with design truly began. His course required him to use a lot of <a

                            software, so he decided to buy a subscription using his new student discount. This meant
                            that I
                            now
                            had access to a whole world of software that I hadn't touched before. By this point <a

                            frame-by-frame animations and showed them off to my friends. But by this point, I had become

                            the time all played instruments. I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt left out. So I went and
                            enrolled at <a

                            really

                            later, my mother told me that she wanted me to start playing the guitar, "Drums aren't a
                            <em>real</em>

                            wasn't cut out of string instruments, and my hatred for the guitar only intensified. I
                            thought a
                            change of music schools might help, so I switched my guitar classes to a different music
                            academy
                            near my house. It was here that my hatred for the guitar <em>really</em> peaked. I left six
                            months
                            later, swearing to never touch that cursed instrument ever again. A few years went by, I
                            continued
                            playing the drums and my guitar sat collecting dust in the far corner of my room. It wasn't
                            till
                            the fourteenth year of my life when I picked up my guitar again. I started re-learning the
                            instrument, with intense dedication and passion and today, I can safely say that I'm a
                            proficient guitarist. As time went by, I learnt the bass, the keyboard, the ukulele, and a
                            whole
                            lot of music theory. My favourite instrument to play today would probably be the guitar,
                            even
                            though I mostly perform as a bassist.

                            I began my journey with public speaking in the ninth grade, when I participated in Jaco
                            Model
                            United Nations, in Calcutta, India. I left with the award of <em>Verbal Mention</em>, and
                            was
                            intensely inspired to continue on this trajectory. Since then, I've participated in numerous
                            local and national MUNs, a plethora of debates, a few international MUNs, and have won
                            multiple
                            awards for public speaking.

                            I've been a voracious reader for as long as I can remember. I've consumed literature with
                            gusto
                            and naturally, this progressed to me trying my hand at creative writing. I wrote my first
                            proper
                            short story during English class, in grade five. It was called "The Attack of the Telephone
                            Monster", and I immensely enjoyed writing it. Since then, I've continued writing short
                            stories,
                            informative articles, and even ran a blog (deprecated) for four years. I've exercised my
                            propensity for writing in the <a href="https://www.tsrsimprint.com/"
                                target="blank"><u>Editorial
                                    Board</u></a> of my school, of which I've been a member for
                            seven years. I now hold the office of Senior Literary Editor and spend most of my time
                            editing
                            articles, formatting newsletters, and providing feedback on the writing of my juniors.
