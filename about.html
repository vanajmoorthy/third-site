                            in
                            the eighth grade. My
                            friend
                            Shiv had learnt some basic markup and was trying to show me how you could create a
                            website
                            with
                            HTML. I dabbled with HTML and CSS for a short while but my passion for programming and
                            computer
                            science didn't arise until the sixteenth year
                            of my life. I choose Computer Science and wrote my first line of Java code
                            <code>System.out.println("Hello, World");</code> in early April. My journey with
                            programming
                            only escalated from there, my CS teacher, Rashmita Ma'am, was incredibly helpful and
                            informative
                            and my friend <a class="sublinks" href="https://kabiroberai.com" target="_blank"><u>Kabir

                            weren't particularly interesting in animating the Hindu god Ganesha, I learnt with
                            fervour
                            and
                            even
                            managed to animate a police officer getting murdered by the end of the year. I've always

                            abysmal at hand-drawn art, so the fact that I could do something that other people
                            admired
                            and

                            I was in the ninth grade when my brother went to university to study architecture. This
                            is
                            when
                            my
                            journey with design truly began. His course required him to use a lot of <a class="sublinks"

                            software, so he decided to buy a subscription using his new student discount. This meant
                            that I
                            now
                            had access to a whole world of software that I hadn't touched before. By this point <a

                            the time all played instruments. I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt left out. So I went
                            and
                            enrolled at <a class="sublinks"

                                target="_blank"><u>Asha Music Academy</u>.</a> It was there that my love for music
                            really
                            began. Some
                            time
                            later, my mother told me that she wanted me to start playing the guitar, "Drums aren't a
                            <em>real</em>
                            instrument", seemed to be a popular notion. So I enrolled in guitar classes. I soon
                            learnt
                            that
                            I
                            wasn't cut out of string instruments, and my hatred for the guitar only intensified. I
                            thought a
                            change of music schools might help, so I switched my guitar classes to a different music
                            academy
                            near my house. It was here that my hatred for the guitar <em>really</em> peaked. I left
                            six
                            months
                            later, swearing to never touch that cursed instrument ever again. A few years went by, I
                            continued
                            playing the drums and my guitar sat collecting dust in the far corner of my room. It
                            wasn't
                            till
                            the fourteenth year of my life when I picked up my guitar again. I started re-learning
                            the
                            instrument, with intense dedication and passion and today, I can safely say that I'm a
                            proficient guitarist. As time went by, I learnt the bass, the keyboard, the ukulele, and
                            a
                            whole
                            lot of music theory. My favourite instrument to play today would probably be the guitar,
                            even
                            though I mostly perform as a bassist.

                        <p class="text-gray-200 inline font-medium"> I began my journey with public speaking in the
                            ninth
                            grade, when I participated in Jaco
                            Model
                            United Nations, in Calcutta, India. I left with the award of <em>Verbal Mention</em>,
                            and
                            was
                            intensely inspired to continue on this trajectory. Since then, I've participated in
                            numerous
                            local and national MUNs, a plethora of debates, a few international MUNs, and have won
                            multiple
                            awards for public speaking.</p>

                            remember. I've consumed literature with
                            gusto
                            and naturally, this progressed to me trying my hand at creative writing. I wrote my
                            first
                            proper
                            short story during English class, in grade five. It was called "The Attack of the
                            Telephone
                            Monster", and I immensely enjoyed writing it. Since then, I've continued writing short
                            stories,
                            informative articles, and even ran a blog (deprecated) for four years. I've exercised my
                            propensity for writing in the <a class="sublinks" href="https://www.tsrsimprint.com/"
