Some time\n                later, my mother told me that she wanted me to start playing the\n                guitar, \"Drums aren't a<em>real</em>\n                instrument\", seemed to be a popular notion. So I enrolled in\n                guitar classes. I soon learnt that I wasn't cut out of string\n                instruments, and my hatred for the guitar only intensified. I\n                thought a change of music schools might help, so I switched my\n                guitar classes to a different music academy near my house. It\n                was here that my hatred for the guitar <em>really</em> peaked. I\n                left six months later, swearing to never touch that cursed\n                instrument ever again. A few years went by, I continued playing\n                the drums and my guitar sat collecting dust in the far corner of\n                my room. It wasn't till the fourteenth year of my life when I\n                picked up my guitar again. I started re-learning the instrument,\n                with intense dedication and passion and today, I can safely say\n                that I'm a proficient guitarist. As time went by, I learnt the\n                bass, the keyboard, the ukulele, and a whole lot of music\n                theory. My favourite instrument to play today would probably be\n                the guitar, even though I mostly perform as a bassist.\n              </p>\n            </li>\n\n            <li>\n              <h2>\n                Public Speaking{\" \"}\n                <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"jsx-a11y/accessible-emoji\">\n                  🎤\n                </span>\n              </h2>\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                I began my journey with public speaking in the ninth grade, when\n                I participated in Jaco Model United Nations, in Calcutta, India.\n                I left with the award of <em>Verbal Mention</em>, and was\n                intensely inspired to continue on this trajectory.
